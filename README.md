Optimal Transport theory has been inherited from the work of Gaspard Monge in the 18th century and deepened developed by Kantorovitch in the 20th century. Optimal Transport as a mathematical framework has various applications such as in Finance. An important concept and hypothesis in financial markets for mathematical models is the Martingale. A martingale is a stochastic process for which the expected value of the next observation is equal to the present observation, given all prior observations. It reflects a fair game where future predictions are always based on the current available information. In early 21st century, researchers in financial markets have decided to merge the Optimal Transport problem with the Martingale constraint. This is innovative because the model does not depend anymore on model assumptions, on specific probability measures but is now called a model independent approach. In this paper, our objective is solve MOT problems related to pricing exotic options through linear programming. To do so, we'll implement several mathematical frameworks and develop an optimizer that will help us find a lower and an upper bound pricing exotic options. To make sure our results do fit our expectations, we will actually compare them with a model dependent approach from an academic paper in the topic.
